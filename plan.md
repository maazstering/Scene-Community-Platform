# Scene - Production Architecture Implementation

## Overview
Building a complete, production-ready mobile-web-first social app for Pakistan with activity matching, event hosting, and venue booking. Invite-only with vouch-based trust system.

**Tech Stack:** Reflex (mobile-web UI), FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy, Redis cache/queues, Celery workers, S3-compatible storage, WebSockets, Docker infrastructure.

**Key Features:** Invite-only onboarding, activity partner finding, event hosting/ticketing, venue discovery/booking, vouch system, payment abstraction (PayFast/JazzCash/Easypaisa), mobile-web share links, dark premium theme.

## Phase 1: Foundation - Data Model, Auth & Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ
**Goal:** Set up complete data model with all entities, authentication system with OTP, and development infrastructure.

### Completed:
- ‚úÖ Complete FastAPI backend with 22 REST API endpoints
- ‚úÖ SQLAlchemy models for all entities (User, Activity, Event, Venue, Vouch, Circle, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication system with token creation/verification
- ‚úÖ OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`
- ‚úÖ Stub implementations for all endpoints
- ‚úÖ In-memory demo data system with 20 Pakistani users
- ‚úÖ 6 venues (paddle courts), 12 activities, 4 events, 4 circles
- ‚úÖ Deterministic seed (random.seed(42))
- ‚úÖ DiceBear avatars for all users
- ‚úÖ Vouches terminology enforced throughout

**API Endpoints Created:**
- **Auth:** Login, Logout, Get Me, Refresh Token
- **Users:** List, Get, Update, Get Vouches
- **Activities:** CRUD, Join Requests, Approve/Reject
- **Events:** CRUD, Join Requests
- **Venues:** List, Get Details, Get Slots
- **Vouches:** Create, List
- **Circles:** CRUD, Add Members

## Phase 2: Frontend Integration with Backend APIs ‚úÖ
**Goal:** Update Reflex frontend to consume backend APIs, replacing in-memory data with real API calls.

### Completed:
- ‚úÖ Created HTTP client utility (`app/utils/api_client.py`)
  - GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE methods
  - JWT token management via parameter
  - Error handling with httpx exceptions
  - Response validation and JSON parsing
  
- ‚úÖ Updated BaseState for authentication
  - Real API call to POST `/api/v1/auth/login`
  - Token storage in localStorage (not cookies)
  - Logout API call to POST `/api/v1/auth/logout`
  - Token validation with optional cookies parameter
  - Fixed cookie parameter type handling
  
- ‚úÖ Updated SceneState for API integration
  - Prepared for API calls to GET `/api/v1/users`
  - Prepared for API calls to GET `/api/v1/activities`
  - Prepared for API calls to GET `/api/v1/events`
  - Prepared for API calls to GET `/api/v1/venues`
  - Updated create_activity_post to call POST `/api/v1/activities`
  - Updated join_activity_request to call POST `/api/v1/activities/{id}/requests`
  
- ‚úÖ Added error handling & loading states
  - `loading: bool` state variable
  - `error_message: str` state variable
  - `success_message: str` state variable
  - Try/except blocks around API calls
  - Toast notifications for errors and success
  
- ‚úÖ Updated WizardState for API integration
  - publish_activity calls POST `/api/v1/activities`
  - publish_event calls POST `/api/v1/events`
  - Error handling with user feedback

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ HTTP client with token authentication
- ‚úÖ Login form with API integration (stub backend)
- ‚úÖ Token storage in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Auth check on page load
- ‚úÖ Error handling for API failures
- ‚úÖ All UI components render correctly

### Known Limitation:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend API returns stub responses (501 Not Implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement actual database operations in Phase 3
